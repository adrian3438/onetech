    "CompanyIntroduction_14": "Vacuum Coating Technology",
    "CompanyIntroduction_15": "is a technology that can dramatically improve the disadvantages of existing materials. By coating low-hardness, low-strength metal materials with ceramic materials that have excellent wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and aesthetic appeal in various colors, the added value of the product can be increased.",
    "CompanyIntroduction_16": "To achieve vacuum coating, a key technology is",
    "CompanyIntroduction_17": "Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)",
    "CompanyIntroduction_18": "which applies ceramic materials (such as TiN, TiCrN, ZrN, TiZrN, TiCN, TiAlN, etc.) at a thickness of 1-3Î¼m onto low-cost carbon steel or high-hardness stainless steel, providing a surface 5-10 times harder than the base material.",
    "CompanyIntroduction_19": "PVD Coating",
    "CompanyIntroduction_20": "A key factor in determining product quality is the adhesion technology between the substrate and the coating layer. This research and development project aims to use high-density plasma technology as a unique pre-treatment method to effectively remove contaminants and oxides from the substrate surface before coating and enhance surface activation, thereby maximizing adhesion between the coating layer and the substrate.",
